# playground-next-remark-mdx

Playground of using `remark-mdx` instead of using `next/mdx` or `next-mdx-remote`.

Motivation for this is to be closer to `unified` interface.

In `unified` ecosystem, was able to get markdown working but not mdx.

Experiment Failed.

Will go back to using `next-mdx-remote`.
